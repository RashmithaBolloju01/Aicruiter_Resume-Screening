# AI Recruiter – Resume Screening

AI Recruiter – Resume Screening is a lightweight automation-focused project that demonstrates how resumes can be programmatically processed and analyzed to support basic screening workflows. Implemented as a Python-based Jupyter Notebook, the project focuses on logical flow, data handling, and structured program design, making it suitable for learning and experimentation.
This project is intended as a foundational step toward intelligent hiring systems, rather than a production-ready recruitment engine.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore how resume data can be parsed, processed, and evaluated using Python. It emphasizes clear logic, modular steps, and readable workflows within a notebook environment.
Rather than focusing on advanced AI accuracy, the project demonstrates how automation and rule-based logic can assist in preliminary resume screening, which can later be extended with more advanced models or backend systems.

## Features

Resume text extraction and preprocessing
Logic-driven screening and analysis flow
Structured, step-by-step implementation in a Jupyter Notebook
Focus on readability, debugging, and maintainable code
Designed for easy extension into more advanced screening systems

## Project Structure

Aicruiter_Resume-Screening/
├── AIrecuiter.ipynb      # Main notebook implementing resume screening logic
├── README.md             # Project documentation

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/RashmithaBolloju01/Aicruiter_Resume-Screening.git
cd Aicruiter_Resume-Screening
2. Open the notebook (AIrecuiter.ipynb) in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
3. Install any required dependencies if prompted
4. Run the cells sequentially to observe the resume screening workflow

## Sample Use Case

A resume document or text input is provided to the notebook.
The system processes the content, applies logical screening steps, and produces structured insights that can assist in initial resume evaluation. This workflow can support recruiters by reducing manual effort in early screening stages.

## Future Enhancements

Integrate more advanced NLP techniques for improved analysis
Add a backend service for scalable resume processing
Support multiple resume formats (PDF, DOCX)
Extend logic with configurable screening rules
Integrate with a web-based interface
